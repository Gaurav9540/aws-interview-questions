**1. What is EC2 ?** <br>
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity in the cloud. It allows users to run virtual servers (instances) on demand, eliminating the need to invest in physical hardware.

**2. What is Horizontal Scalling & Vertical Scalling ?** <br>
Auto Scaling in AWS helps dynamically adjust computing resources to meet application demands. There are two main types of scaling: Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling. <br>

1. Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In) - 
Definition: Horizontal scaling (also called scaling out) involves adding more EC2 instances to distribute the workload. Scaling in removes instances when demand decreases.

2. Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down) - 
Definition: Vertical scaling (also called scaling up) involves increasing the size (CPU, RAM, disk) of a single EC2 instance. Scaling down reduces the instance size when demand decreases.
