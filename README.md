**3. What is Horizontal Scalling & Vertical Scalling ?** <br>
Auto Scaling in AWS helps dynamically adjust computing resources to meet application demands. There are two main types of scaling: Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling. <br>

1. Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In) - 
Definition: Horizontal scaling (also called scaling out) involves adding more EC2 instances to distribute the workload. Scaling in removes instances when demand decreases.

2. Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down) - 
Definition: Vertical scaling (also called scaling up) involves increasing the size (CPU, RAM, disk) of a single EC2 instance. Scaling down reduces the instance size when demand decreases.


**4. Steps to Create Auto Scalling in AWS ?** <br>
Auto Scaling in AWS ensures that your application can handle varying levels of traffic by automatically adding or removing EC2 instances. Follow these steps to set up Auto Scaling in AWS: <br>
Step 1: Create a Launch Template or Launch Configuration <br>
Step 2: Create an Auto Scaling Group <br>
Step 3: Configure Scaling Policies <br>
Step 4: Attach a Load Balancer (Optional) <br>
Step 5: Review and Create <br>

<hr>

**5. ALB (Application Load Balancer) v/s ASG (Auto Scaling Group) ?** <br>
ALB (Application Load Balancer) and ASG (Auto Scaling Group) are both AWS services that improve availability, scalability, and reliability, but they serve different purposes. <br>
1. What is ALB (Application Load Balancer)? <br>
‚úÖ Purpose: ALB distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances in different availability zones to ensure load balancing. <br>

2. What is ASG (Auto Scaling Group)? <br>
‚úÖ Purpose: ASG automatically scales EC2 instances up or down based on demand. <br>


 **6. What is Load Balancing ?** <br>
 Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic evenly across multiple servers or resources to ensure high availability, reliability, and 
 performance. <br>
 In AWS, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes traffic across EC2 instances, containers, and even Lambda functions. <br>

 Types of Load Balancers in AWS <br>
 1. Classic Load Balancer (CLB) <br>
 2. Application Load Balancer (ALB) <br>
 3. Network Load Balancer (NLB) <br>
 4. Gateway Load Balancer (GLB) <br>

 <hr>

 **7. What is VPC ?** <br>
 AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a private, isolated network within AWS that allows you to securely run cloud resources like EC2, RDS, and Lambda. <br>
 Think of it as your own data center in the cloud, where you can define networking rules, control access, and connect to the internet or other networks. <br>

 **8. Components of VPC ?** <br>
 1. CIDR Block (IP Address Range) <br>
 2. Subnets (Public & Private) <br>
 3. Internet Gateway (IGW) <br>
 4. NAT Gateway <br>
 5. Route Tables <br>
 6. Security Groups & NACLs <br>

 VPC Architecture Example: <br>
 VPC (10.0.0.0/16) <br>
 ‚îÇ <br>
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Public Subnet (10.0.1.0/24) - Web Servers (With Internet Gateway) <br>
 ‚îÇ <br>
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Private Subnet (10.0.2.0/24) - Application Servers (No Internet Access) <br>
 ‚îÇ <br>
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Private Subnet (10.0.3.0/24) - Databases (RDS) (Completely Private) <br>


**9. Private Subnet v/s Public Subnet ?** <br>
1. Public Subnet - 
A public subnet has direct internet access because it is associated with an Internet Gateway (IGW) and has a route to 0.0.0.0/0. <br>

2. Private Subnet -
A private subnet has no direct internet access‚Äîit does NOT have a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW). <br>

Public vs. Private Subnet Architecture Example <br>
VPC (10.0.0.0/16) <br>
‚îÇ <br>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Public Subnet (10.0.1.0/24) - Web Servers, ALB  [Connected to IGW] <br>
‚îÇ <br>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Private Subnet (10.0.2.0/24) - App Servers [No Internet Access] <br>
‚îÇ <br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Private Subnet (10.0.3.0/24) - Database (RDS) [Completely Private] <br>

 **Diff Between Security groups and NACL**
 
 1. Security Groups - A Security Group in AWS acts as a virtual firewall that controls the inbound and outbound traffic to your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, etc.
     - stateful only define inbound rule outbound rule managed by aws
     - we can create security group at instance level
     - we can add only allow rule deny rule not possible in security group 
        
2. NACL - A Network ACL (NACL) in AWS is a network-level firewall that controls traffic in and out of subnets in your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
     - stateless need to efine both inbound as well as outbound rules
     - we can create NACL at subnet level
     - we can add allow as well as deny rule in NACL
     - mostly use in complex scenarios

  - if we create an NACL all the Inbound and Outbound rules are by default deny
  - but the by default NACL all the Inbound and Outbound rules are by default allow
